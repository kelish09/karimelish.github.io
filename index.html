<h3>Short Bio</h3>

<p>
Since 2016, I have been a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at Florida Polytechnic University, where I currently serve as an Associate Professor. I am a Co-director of the INSIGHT Lab, where I have been fortunate to collaborate with and mentor several students, including Fulbright scholars and students. Prior to joining Florida Poly, I held a faculty appointment as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Purdue University Fort Wayne. In 2025, I received the <em><strong>Fulbright Specialist Program Award</strong></em>. In 2018, I received the Florida Poly <em><strong> ABLAZE Award for Excellence in Teaching </strong></em>  for exemplary pedagogical practices, exceptional teaching effectiveness, contributions to course and program development, and sustained efforts to foster students’ intellectual growth and critical thinking. I am a Senior Member of the ACM and IEEE.
