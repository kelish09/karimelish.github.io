    <h3>DroidMalVet Dataset</h3>

    <p>
      This dataset provides a curated collection of 20 code-level metrics extracted from
      Android malware applications, each labeled with its corresponding malware family. It comprises 29,162 malicious apps categorized into 202 malware families.
      The metrics capture structural and behavioral properties of malicious apps and are grouped into
      four categories: complexity, dimensional, object-oriented,
      and Android-oriented metrics.
    </p>

    <p>
      These metrics were extracted by decompiling each malicious application into smali code
      and analyzing it with a modified static analysis tool. This dataset enables researchers to study malware
      family detection, characterization, and evolution using a compact and efficient feature set.
    </p>
